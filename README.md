it is a final python project

Preprocessing:

The code loads the dataset from the provided Google Sheets link using pd.read_csv() function from the pandas library.
It corrects the data in the "height" column by generating random numbers between 150 and 180 for each row using np.random.randint() function from the numpy library.
Analysis Tasks:

For each analysis task, appropriate operations are performed on the dataset to derive insights.
Team distribution is calculated using value_counts(normalize=True) on the "team" column to determine the percentage split across teams.
Position distribution is calculated using value_counts() on the "position" column to segregate employees based on their positions.
Predominant age group among employees is determined by creating age bins and using pd.cut() to categorize employees into age groups, followed by value_counts() to count occurrences.
Highest salary expenditure by team and position is obtained by grouping the data by team and position and summing the salaries.
Correlation between age and salary is investigated using a scatter plot generated with sns.scatterplot() from the seaborn library.
Graphical Representation:

For each analysis task, appropriate visualizations are created to present the findings effectively.
Bar charts, pie charts, histograms, and scatter plots are used as needed to visualize the distribution of employees across teams, positions, age groups, and the relationship between age and salary.
Data Story:

Insights gained from the analysis are provided in text format.
Key trends, patterns, correlations, and conclusions drawn from the analysis are highlighted.
The significance of the analysis and its implications for decision-making are discussed

Name: count, dtype: int64

3. Predominant Age Group Among Employees: 20-29

4. Team with the Highest Salary Expenditure: Cleveland Cavaliers
   Position with the Highest Salary Expenditure: C

5. Correlation between Age and Salary:
